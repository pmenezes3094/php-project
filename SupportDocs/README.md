PROJECT ABUNDANCE

Project Abundance is a bookmarking tool that helps users save any image, text, video, audio or web link from their system or from the internet without worrying about saving them in a rigid folder structure. The tool allows users to retrieve data that they've saved easily, without having to memorize file paths.
